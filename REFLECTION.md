# What I Learned Using AI Agents

When I started the FuelEU Maritime project, tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT felt like cool extras — now I see them as powerful coding partners.  
Copilot handled all the repetitive stuff (TypeScript interfaces, props, boilerplate) so I could focus on real logic.  

But it wasn’t magic — I had to double-check every AI snippet, especially around business rules and data validation. Sometimes Copilot invented fields or logic that didn’t exist, and catching those made me understand the system better.

Breaking big prompts into smaller, clear questions for ChatGPT and Claude also helped a ton — less chaos, more control.

# Efficiency vs Manual Coding

This build easily went 2x faster thanks to AI help.  
Instead of wasting time on boilerplate, I spent it refining features, UI, and debugging.  
Still, merging AI code sometimes caused type mismatches or weird assumptions — having tests in place saved me every time.

# What I’ll Do Better Next Time

- No blind copy-pasting:Only keep AI code I fully understand.  
- Ask sharper prompts:Be specific, not vague.  
- Automate logging:Streamline how I save agent prompts (like in `AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`).  
- Use AI more for UI:Styling mistakes are cheap — business logic isn’t.  

# Final Thought

AI tools made me faster and more thoughtful as a developer.  
They don’t replace thinking — they amplify it. And that’s the real win.
